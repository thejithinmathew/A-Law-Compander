# A-Law-Compander
This python program is used to read a xls file to do A-Law Companding on a Signal, in my case ss.xls. 
Note:Please edit the file name before running your signal.

The code has three methods:
1. run() : To run the speech signal.
2. alaw() : To do A-Law companding per bit.
3. dealaw()n : To decode the coded signal.
